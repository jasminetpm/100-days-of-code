# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start on freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours).    
Completed 28/28 lessons in **Basic HTML and HTML5**.

**Thoughts:** Since I finish my work quite early everyday, I'm going to use this time to code!

### Day 3: 7 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 11/52 lessons of **Applied Visual Design**.

**Thoughts:** Completed less than I wanted to! Wasted about 2hrs searching for plane tickets to Bali today for a solo surf trip. Decided not to get them anyway. Also, the only button of my skirt popped out today lol. Meeting Shu and Zendy for dinner so no time to complete.

### Day 4: 14 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 19 lessons to make 30/52 lessons of **Applied Visual Design**.

**Thoughts:** LOL it's been 7 days since I last touched this. Some days I go out with friends and some days I get home and just wanna chill. There was a rly stupid escalation at work today where a customer submitted a port request yesterday (Weds) but wants it completed by Monday. Like hello, porting is clearly stated to take 4-6 weeks. Nonetheless, tried my best to push it through. Called Nick about 5x, I hope he doesn't hate me now.
