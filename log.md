# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start on freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours).    
Completed 28/28 lessons in **Basic HTML and HTML5**.

**Thoughts:** Since I finish my work quite early everyday, I'm going to use this time to code! Uhm, wanted to start on freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Certification but realised I need to learn my HTML and CSS properly lol. Here's to starting from the beginning.
