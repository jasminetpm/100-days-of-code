# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start on freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours).    
Completed 28/28 lessons in **Basic HTML and HTML5**.

**Thoughts:** Since I finish my work quite early everyday, I'm going to use this time to code! Uhm, wanted to start on freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Certification but realised I need to learn my HTML and CSS properly lol. Here's to starting from the beginning.

### Day 2: 6 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 44/44 lessons of **Basic CSS**.

**Thoughts:** Finished my work at 11.30am today.    
44 lessons is a lot compared to yesterday!

### Day 3: 7 November, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 25/52 lessons of **Applied Visual Design**.

**Thoughts:** Completed less than I wanted to! Was searching for plane tickets to Bali today for a solo surf trip but decided not to get them anyway. Wasted about 2hrs doing that. Also, the only button of my skirt popped out today, so that was a bit of a hassle. Thank God I managed to sew it back LOL. Why is my life like that.
